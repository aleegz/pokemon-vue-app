## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): You will need Node.js to handle dependencies and run the development server. You can download it from the official website. The recommended version is the LTS (Long Term Support).
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): npm is the package manager that comes with Node.js by default. Alternatively, you can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) if you prefer.

You can check if you have Node.js and npm installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
